Hello, everyone! We're in a new video explaining how to solve the door puzzles in Hogwarts Legacy. Let's begin.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
First of all, we need to cast Revelio to find the rolling objects with a question mark and two question marks, respectively.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Sometimes, they may be in different rooms.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Next, we need to go to the door and press the square button to reveal the number sequence.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
As we can see, we have a 5 and a 12.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Solving these puzzles is actually quite simple.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
What we need to do is make sure that the sum of the smaller circles at the edges of the triangle equals the result of the large number.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
For this, there's a guide that I'll show on the screen with the values of each symbol.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Each of these symbols represents a value starting from 0 up to 9.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
In this case, we need to do 3 plus 0 plus 2.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
And the position 2 corresponds to this goat-like creature.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Because this is 0, 1, and 2.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
So, 3 plus 0 plus 2 equals 5.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
We approach the rolling object with a question mark and set the same symbol as on the door.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
For the second symbol, we have 12.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
We need to do the same.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
In this case, we already have the drawing of the unicorn.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So we know its value is 1.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Now, we need to do 1 plus 4 plus the symbol corresponding to 7, which in this case is this octopus-like figure.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
We approach the object with two question marks and set the octopus.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Once that's done, we approach the door and press open.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
As we can see, it has unlocked, and we can now enter the room to collect the loot.
